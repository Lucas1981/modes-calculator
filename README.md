# modes-calculator

This is a simple program that will show you all the modes and the chords and where to play them
in a major scale.

## How to use

```
$ node main.js # outputs scales, chords and a table with all the chords for a E
$ node generate-chords-for-all-keys.js # outputs chords for all keys as a JSON
$ node generate-tables-for-all-keys.js # outputs chords for all keys as a table
```

The output files are all stored in the `./output` folder.
