# modes-calculator

This is a simple program that will show you all the modes and the chords and where to play them
in a major scale. It's hard-coded to 'E' and works with that, but haven't tested it in other keys. I was thinking of actually just saving the computed template and just applying it to other scales a user might choose, it can get tricky calculating it with flats and sharps needing special attention.

## How to use

```
$ node modes-calculator.js # outputs scales, chords and a table with all the chords.
```
